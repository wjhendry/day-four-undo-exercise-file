Thanks you for this very good course.
It has been very useful to me.
I can see you have taken a lot of time to make things clear.
The only difficult bit was the bit about undoing changes in day 4 - I had to try the final exercise several times.
I found out that I was doing it correctly those other times, but I was worried about the detached HEAD.
But this was the only tough bit. The rest is exemplary.
Again, thank you.
